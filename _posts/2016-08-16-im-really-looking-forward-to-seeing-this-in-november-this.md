  I'm really looking forward to seeing this in November. This feels like the
  kind of semi-hard science fiction that I like to read, somewhat like Contact,
  Gravity and Interstellar. I like the "ask questions first, shoot never" kind
  of approach that Amy Adam's character appears to want. Dr. Ellie Arroway would
  approve.
